# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Purpose

What's the purpose of this? I wanted to toy around with scraping data using node/react/postgres, that is all. My thought process as to choosing steam, is I play a ton of games, and know there's a ton of information about each game listing (store page, patch notes, reviews, community, etc) and wanted to take a stab at creating a new public viewable layout for all of this information.
